### Hi there 👋


One of the hard-days in my life was a farewell to my school and I can never forget a great saying that my teacher had told me, which is a rule to my life. Those words motivated me to increase productivity and added great value to my life, thereafter, it has changed my lifestyle.
  
- **The little things you do daily, that will make a huge difference over the time.**
Precisely
     -   1.01^365^ = 37.8  
     -   0.99^365^ = 0.03

Hi! I'm **Sai Krishna Sunkari** and I am passionately curious.

My career experience and skills evolved from my childhood hobbies: exploring, understanding how things work around me.  Since I was a high school student, I started writing the code and it became habitual. Starting with the 'Hello World' program to developing the 'Attendance Management System' as the major project and few projects in between.

This passion carried throughout my education and has handed me a job that I love to do.

I began my career as an intern and started learning, developing Decentralized Applications (dApps) using Ethereum Blockchain. The more I knew about Etheruem, the more I understood its cons, developing the dApps. Over time, I choose Cosmos (app chains) over Ethereum Blockchain to develop the projects.

Now I can develop projects on Cosmos/Tendermint, Ethereum, and Hyperledger Fabric.

Skills: 
  - Programming Languages: C, Python, Golang, Java, JavaScript
  - Designing & Modeling: Adobe Illustrator, After Effects, Maya 

The qualities you can find in me
- I constantly learn because I never like to settle
- I focus on making high-quality decisions 

So, the passion to learn new things remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, problems to solve and more to build. For this, I am very grateful.
